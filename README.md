ðŸ‘‹ My name is Van Ha. I am a self-taught developer with knowledge of React, Next, API integrations, data storage, blockchains, and reasonable business logic in the financial markets. Both lack a solid foundation and a lot of experience, but I do have a very strong work ethic, sense of discipline, drive, and attention to detail. I want to work on a team or project where we are always pushed to our boundaries and where we can all contribute, learn, and advance together.
